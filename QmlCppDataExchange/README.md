# Data exchange between QML and C++ 

This piece of code demonstrates the possibilities to exchange data between QML and C++. 

It shows
- calling C++ methods from QML 
- setting the QML parameters from C++ and handling the corresponding event
- connecting a QML signal with a C++ slot within the C++ implementation
